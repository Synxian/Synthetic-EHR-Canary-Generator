## Instructions

You must create a ```.env``` file, with the contents of ```.env.template```

Args:

- --output_dir, -o: Directory to save generated canaries.
- --dataset, -d: The reference dataset for canary generation. For custom datasets new functions may be needed.
- --input_file, -i: JSON file for the canaries options. For custom dataset new functions may be needed.
- --temperature, -t: Model temperature.
- --mode, -m: Mode for the canaries generation.
        Single is for single entries.
        History is to generate a thread of connected medical visits for each set of tags.
- --n_samples, n: How many canaries for each set of tags to make.
        If mode is single, it will generate single n_samples for each set of tags.
        If mode is history, it will generate an history composed of n_samples for each set of tags.
